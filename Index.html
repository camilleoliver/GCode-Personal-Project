      <h3 id="Where"> Where am I from?</h3>
      <p class = "answer">I was born and raised in Atlanta, GA. I love being from there, Atlanta is a city where I grew up being
        able to simply be myself. At this time in my life I enjoy listening to music, watching
         great TV shows, spending time outside, and reading.

      <span id="career-goals"><h3>Career Goals?</h3>
      <p id="career-answer">When I was little I wanted to be a ...
         Doctor, then lawyer. I ended up working in Marketing.. I think I should have
         been an engineer. A couple challenges I have faced include finding out what my
         purpose and calling is in life. I jump around in working industries and wish I
         could find something I am passionate about.
         I think I am starting to find that with coding, I would like to learn and then teach. Sharing knowledge is what I
         enjoy and believe to be my calling.

        <li>I can never leave the house without my chapstick. There’s no way I’m leaving without it, and if I <!DOCTYPE html>
        I am buying more as soon as I can.</li>

      <h3 id = "More">More about me...</h3>
      <p class = "answer">A random fear I have is of heights, I think I am developing that fear as I age.
         I’m not sure what my high shool superlative was, I don’t think I stuck out in any way in HS, I was still finding
         myself. Now though I think I would be most likely to be famous or most likely to be successful..
      </p>
      <p class = "answer">My random skill is that I learned how to speed walk really well, I like to challenge people then blow them out of the water. </p>
